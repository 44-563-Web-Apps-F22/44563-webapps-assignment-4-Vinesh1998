        ACT II<br>

        <p>
        
          CHORUS.        Yes, Britain won, etc.
        
                    When Wellington thrashed Bonaparte,
                         As every child can tell,
                    The House of Peers, throughout the war,
                    Did nothing in particular,
                         And did it very well:
                    Yet Britain set the world ablaze
                    In good King George's glorious days!<br>
        
          CHORUS.        Yes, Britain set, etc.
        
                    And while the House of Peers withholds
                         Its legislative hand,
                    And noble statesmen do not itch
                    To interfere with matters which
                         They do not understand,
                    As bright will shine Great Britain's rays
                    As in King George's glorious days!<br>
        
          CHORUS.        As bright will shine, etc.
        
               LEILA. (who has been much attracted by the Peers during this
          song).  Charming persons, are they not?
               CELIA.  Distinctly.  For self-contained dignity, combined with
          airy condescension, give me a British Representative Peer!
               LORD TOLL.  Then pray stop this protege of yours before it's
          too late.  Think of the mischief you're doing!
               LEILA (crying).  But we can't stop him now.  (Aside to Celia.)
          Aren't they lovely!  (Aloud.)  Oh, why did you go and defy us, you
          great geese!<br>
        
                               DUET—LEILA and CELIA.
        
          LEILA.              In vain to us you plead—
                                             Don't go!
                              Your prayers we do not heed—
                                             Don't go!
                                   It's true we sigh,
                                        But don't suppose
                                   A tearful eye
                                        Forgiveness shows.
                                             Oh, no!
                              We're very cross indeed—
                                   Yes, very cross,
                                             Don't go!<br>
        
          FAIRIES.                 It's true we sigh, etc.<br>
        
          CELIA.              Your disrespectful sneers—
                                             Don't go!
                              Call forth indignant tears—
                                             Don't go!
                                   You break our laws—
                                        You are our foe:
                                   We cry because
                                        We hate you so!
                                             You know!
                              You very wicked Peers!
                                   You wicked Peers!
                                             Don't go!<br>
        
               FAIRIES.                      LORDS MOUNT. and TOLL.
        
          You break our laws—          Our disrespectful sneers,
               You are our foe:                   Ha, ha!
          We cry because                Call forth indignant tears,
               We hate you so!                    Ha, ha!
                         You know!      If that's the case, my dears—
          You very wicked Peers!   FAIRIES.  Don't go!
                         Don't go! PEERS.    We'll go!
        
          (Exeunt Lord Mountararat, Lord Tolloller, and Peers.  Fairies gaze
          wistfully after them.)
        
                                  (Enter Fairy Queen.)
        
               QUEEN.  Oh, shame—shame upon you!  Is this your fidelity to
          the laws you are bound to obey?  Know ye not that it is death to
          marry a mortal?
               LEILA.  Yes, but it's not death to wish to marry a mortal!
               FLETA.  If it were, you'd have to execute us all!
               QUEEN.  Oh, this is weakness!  Subdue it!
               CELIA.  We know it's weakness, but the weakness is so strong!
               LEILA.  We are not all as tough as you are!
               QUEEN.  Tough!  Do you suppose that I am insensible to the
          effect of manly beauty?  Look at that man!  (Referring to Sentry.)
          A perfect picture!  (To Sentry.)  Who are you, sir?
               WILLIS (coming to "attention").  Private Willis, B Company,
          1st Grenadier Guards.
               QUEEN.  You're a very fine fellow, sir.
               WILLIS.  I am generally admired.
               QUEEN.  I can quite understand it.  (To Fairies.)  Now here is
          a man whose physical attributes are simply godlike.  That man has
          a most extraordinary effect upon me.  If I yielded to a natural
          impulse, I should fall down and worship that man.  But I mortify
          this inclination; I wrestle with it, and it lies beneath my feet!
          That is how I treat my regard for that man!
        
                                 SONG—FAIRY QUEEN.
        
                              Oh, foolish fay,
                                   Think you, because
                              His brave array
                                   My bosom thaws,
                              I'd disobey
                                   Our fairy laws?
                              Because I fly
                                   In realms above,
                              In tendency
                                   To fall in love,
                              Resemble I
                                   The amorous dove?
          (Aside.)            Oh, amorous dove!
                                   Type of Ovidius Naso!
                                        This heart of mine
                                        Is soft as thine,
                              Although I dare not say so!
        
          CHORUS.             Oh, amorous dove, etc.
        
                              On fire that glows
                                   With heat intense
                              I turn the hose
                                   Of common sense,
                              And out it goes
                                   At small expense!
                              We must maintain
                                   Our fairy law;
                              That is the main
                                   On which to draw—
                              In that we gain
                                   A Captain Shaw!
          (Aside.)                 Oh, Captain Shaw!
                                        Type of true love kept under!
                                             Could thy Brigade
                                             With cold cascade
                                        Quench my great love, I wonder!
        
          CHORUS.             Oh, Captain Shaw! etc.
        
                       (Exeunt Fairies and Fairy Queen, sorrowfully.)
        
                                     (Enter Phyllis.)
        
               PHYL.  (half crying).  I can't think why I'm not in better
          spirits.  I'm engaged to two noblemen at once.  That ought to be
          enough to make any girl happy.  But I'm miserable!  Don't suppose
          it's because I care for Strephon, for I hate him!  No girl could
          care for a man who goes about with a mother considerably younger
          than himself!
        
                      (Enter Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller.)
        
               LORD MOUNT.  Phyllis!  My darling!
               LORD TOLL.  Phyllis!  My own!
               PHYL.  Don't!  How dare you?  Oh, but perhaps you're the two
          noblemen I'm engaged to?
               LORD MOUNT.  I am one of them.
               LORD TOLL.  I am the other.
               PHYL.  Oh, then, my darling!  (to Lord Mountararat).  My own!
          (to Lord Tolloller).  Well, have you settled which it's to be?
               LORD TOLL.  Not altogether.  It's a difficult position.  It
          would be hardly delicate to toss up.  On the whole we would rather
          leave it to you.
               PHYL.  How can it possibly concern me?  You are both EarIs,
          and you are both rich, and you are both plain.
               LORD MOUNT.  So we are.  At least I am.
               LORD TOLL.  So am I.
               LORD MOUNT.  No, no!
               LORD TOLL.  I am indeed.  Very plain.
               LORD MOUNT.  Well, well—perhaps you are.
               PHYL.  There's really nothing to choose between you.  If one
          of you would forgo his title, and distribute his estates among his
          Irish tenantry, why, then, I should then see a reason for accepting
          the other.
               LORD MOUNT.  Tolloller, are you prepared to make this
          sacrifice?
               LORD TOLL.  No!
               LORD MOUNT.  Not even to oblige a lady?
               LORD TOLL.  No! not even to oblige a lady.
               LORD MOUNT.  Then, the only question is, which of us shall
          give way to the other?  Perhaps, on the whole, she would be happier
          with me.  I don't know.  I may be wrong.
               LORD TOLL.  No.  I don't know that you are.  I really believe
          she would.  But the awkward part of the thing is that if you rob me
          of the girl of my heart, we must fight, and one of us must die.
          It's a family tradition that I have sworn to respect.  It's a
          painful position, for I have a very strong regard for you, George.
               LORD MOUNT. (much affected).  My dear Thomas!
               LORD TOLL.  You are very dear to me, George.  We were boys
          together—at least I was.  If I were to survive you, my existence
          would be hopelessly embittered.
               LORD MOUNT.  Then, my dear Thomas, you must not do it.  I say
          it again and again—if it will have this effect upon you, you must
          not do it.  No, no.  If one of us is to destroy the other, let it
          be me!
               LORD TOLL.  No, no!
               LORD MOUNT.  Ah, yes!—by our boyish friendship I implore you!
               LORD TOLL. (much moved).  Well, well, be it so.  But,
          no—no!—I cannot consent to an act which would crush you with
          unavaillng remorse.
               LORD MOUNT.  But it would not do so.  I should be very sad at
          first—oh, who would not be?—but it would wear off.  I like you
          very much—but not, perhaps, as much as you like me.
               LORD TOLL.  George, you're a noble fellow, but that tell-tale
          tear betrays you.  No, George; you are very fond of me, and I
          cannot consent to give you a week's uneasiness on my account.
               LORD MOUNT.  But, dear Thomas, it would not last a week!
          Remember, you lead the House of Lords!  On your demise I shall take
          your place!  Oh, Thomas, it would not last a day!
               PHYL. (coming down).  Now, I do hope you're not going to fight
          about me, because it's really not worth while.
               LORD TOLL. (looking at her).  Well, I don't believe it is!
               LORD MOUNT.  Nor I.  The sacred ties of Friendship are
          paramount.
        
                             QUARTET—LORD MOUNTARARAT,
                    LORD TOLLOLLER, PHYLLIS, and PRIVATE WILLIS.
        
          LORD TOLL.     Though p'r'aps I may incur your blame,
                              The things are few
                              I would not do
                         In Friendship's name!
        
          LORD MOUNT.    And I may say I think the same;
                              Not even love
                              Should rank above
                         True Friendship's name!
        
          PHYL.          Then free me, pray; be mine the blame;
                              Forget your craze
                              And go your ways
                         In Friendship's name!
        
          ALL.           Oh, many a man, in Friendship's name,
                         Has yielded fortune, rank, and fame!
                         But no one yet, in the world so wide,
                         Has yielded up a promised bride!
        
          WILLIS.        Accept, O Friendship, all the same,
        
          ALL.           This sacrifice to thy dear name!
        
          (Exeunt Lord Mountararat and Lord Tolloller, lovingly, in one
          direction, and Phyllis in another.  Exit Sentry.)
        
                         (Enter Lord Chancellor, very miserable.)
        
                            RECITATIVE—LORD CHANCELLOR.
        
                    Love, unrequited, robs me of my rest:
                         Love, hopeless love, my ardent soul encumbers:
                    Love, nightmare-like, lies heavy on my chest,
                         And weaves itself into my midnight slumbers!
        
                               SONG—LORD CHANCELLOR.
        
          When you're lying awake with a dismal headache, and repose is
          taboo'd by anxiety,
          I conceive you may use any language you choose to indulge in,
          without impropriety;
          For your brain is on fire—the bedclothes conspire of usual
          slumber to plunder you:
          First your counterpane goes, and uncovers your toes, and your
          sheet slips demurely from under you;
          Then the blanketing tickles—you feel like mixed pickles—so
          terribly sharp is the pricking,
          And you're hot, and you're cross, and you tumble and toss till
          there's nothing 'twixt you and the ticking.
          Then the bedclothes all creep to the ground in a heap, and you
          pick 'em all up in a tangle;
          Next your pillow resigns and politely declines to remain at its
          usual angle!
          Well, you get some repose in the form of a doze, with hot
          eye-balls and head ever aching.
          But your slumbering teems with such horrible dreams that you'd
          very much better be waking;
          For you dream you are crossing the Channel, and tossing about in
          a steamer from Harwich—
          Which is something between a large bathing machine and a very
          small second-class carriage—
          And you're giving a treat (penny ice and cold meat) to a party of
          friends and relations—
          They're a ravenous horde—and they all came on board at Sloane
          Square and South Kensington Stations.
          And bound on that journey you find your attorney (who started  that
          morning from Devon);
          He's a bit undersized, and you don't feel surprised when he tells
          you he's only eleven.
          Well, you're driving like mad with this singular lad (by the by,
          the ship's now a four-wheeler),
          And you're playing round games, and he calls you bad names when
          you tell him that "ties pay the dealer";
          But this you can't stand, so you throw up your hand, and you find
          you're as cold as an icicle,
          In your shirt and your socks (the black silk with gold clocks),
          crossing Salisbury Plain on a bicycle:
          And he and the crew are on bicycles too—which they've somehow   or
          other invested in—
          And he's telling the tars all the particulars of a company he's
          interested in—
          It's a scheme of devices, to get at low prices all goods from
          cough mixtures to cables
          (Which tickled the sailors), by treating retailers as though they
          were all vegetables—
          You get a good spadesman to plant a small tradesman (first take
          off his boots with a boot-tree),
          And his legs will take root, and his fingers will shoot, and
          they'll blossom and bud like a fruit-tree—
          From the greengrocer tree you get grapes and green pea,
          cauliflower, pineapple, and cranberries,
          While the pastrycook plant cherry brandy will grant, apple puffs,
          and three corners, and Banburys—
          The shares are a penny, and ever so many are taken by Rothschild
          and Baring,
          And just as a few are allotted to you, you awake with a shudder
          despairing—
          You're a regular wreck, with a crick in your neck, and no wonder
          you snore, for your head's on the floor, and you've needles and
          pins from your soles to your shins, and your flesh is a-creep, for
          your left leg's asleep, and you've cramp in your toes, and a fly on
          your nose, and some fluff in your lung, and a feverish tongue, and
          a thirst that's intense, and a general sense that you haven't been
          sleeping in clover;
          But the darkness has passed, and it's daylight at last, and the
          night has been long—ditto ditto my song—and thank goodness
          they're both of them over!
        
                                         (Lord Chancellor falls exhausted on
          a seat.)
        
                      (Enter Lords Mountararat and Tolloller.)
        
               LORD MOUNT.  I am much distressed to see your Lordship in this
          condition.
               LORD CH.  Ah, my Lords, it is seldom that a Lord Chancellor
          has reason to envy the position of another, but I am free to
          confess that I would rather be two Earls engaged to Phyllis than
          any other half-dozen noblemen upon the face of the globe.
               LORD TOLL. (without enthusiasm).  Yes.  It's an enviable
          position when you're the only one.
               LORD MOUNT.  Oh yes, no doubt—most enviable.  At the same
          time, seeing you thus, we naturally say to ourselves, "This is very
          sad.  His Lordship is constitutionally as blithe as a bird—he
          trills upon the bench like a thing of song and gladness.  His
          series of judgements in F sharp minor, given andante in six-eight
          time, are among the most remarkable effects ever produced in a
          Court of Chancery.  He is, perhaps, the only living instance of a
          judge whose decrees have received the honour of a double encore.
          How can we bring ourselves to do that which will deprive the Court
          of Chancery of one of its most attractive features?"
               LORD CH.  I feel the force of your remarks, but I am here in
          two capacities, and they clash, my Lords, they clash!  I deeply
          grieve to say that in declining to entertain my last application to
          myself, I presumed to address myself in terms which render it
          impossible for me ever to apply to myself again.  It was a most
          painful scene, my Lords—most painful!
               LORD TOLL.  This is what it is to have two capacities!  Let us
          be thankful that we are persons of no capacity whatever.
               LORD MOUNT.  Come, come.  Remember you are a very just and
          kindly old gentleman, and you need have no hesitation in
          approaching yourself, so that you do so respectfully and with a
          proper show of deference.
               LORD CH.  Do you really think so?
               LORD MOUNT.  I do.
               LORD CH.  Well, I will nerve myself to another effort, and,
          if that fails, I resign myself to my fate!
        
               TRIO—LORD CHANCELLOR, LORDS MOUNTARARAT and TOLLOLLER.
        
          LORD MOUNT.         If you go in
                              You're sure to win—
                         Yours will be the charming maidie:
                              Be your law
                              The ancient saw,
                         "Faint heart never won fair lady!"
        
          ALL.           Never, never, never,
                         Faint heart never won fair lady!
                              Every journey has an end—
                              When at the worst affairs will mend—
                              Dark the dawn when day is nigh—
                              Hustle your horse and don't say die!
        
          LORD TOLL.          He who shies
                              At such a prize
                         Is not worth a maravedi,
                              Be so kind
                              To bear in mind—
                         Faint heart never won fair lady!
        
          ALL.           Never, never, never,
                         Faint heart never won fair lady!
                              While the sun shines make your hay—
                              Where a will is, there's a way—
                              Beard the lion in his lair—
                              None but the brave deserve the fair!
        
          LORD CH.            I'll take heart
                              And make a start—
                         Though I fear the prospect's shady—
                              Much I'd spend
                              To gain my end—
                         Faint heart never won fair lady!
        
          ALL.           Never, never, never,
                         Faint heart never won fair lady!
                              Nothing venture, nothing win—
                              Blood is thick, but water's thin—
                              In for a penny, in for a pound—
                              It's Love that makes the world go round!

          together.)
        
                           (Enter Strephon, in very low spirits.)
        
          [The following song was deleted from production]
        
                    Fold your flapping wings,
                         Soaring legislature.

                    Let's begin at home,
                         Crime is no exotic.
                    Bitter is your bane
                         Terrible your trials

                    Take a tipsy lout
                         Gathered from the gutter,
                    Hustle him about,
                         Strap him to a shutter.
                    What am I but he,
                         Washed at hours stated.
                    Fed on filagree,
                         Clothed and educated
                    He's a mark of scorn
                         I might be another
                    If I had been born
                         Of a tipsy mother.
                    Take a wretched thief,

                    What is he but I
                         Robbed of all my chances
                    Picking pockets by
                         force of circumstances
                              I might be as bad,
                                   As unlucky, rather,
                              If I'd only had,
                                   Fagin for a father.
        
               STREPH.  I suppose one ought to enjoy oneself in Parliament,
          when one leads both Parties, as I do!  But I'm miserable, poor,
          broken-hearted fool that I am!  Oh Phyllis, Phyllis!—
        
                                    (Enter Phyllis.)
               PHYL.  Yes.
               STREPH. (surprised).  Phyllis!  But I suppose I should say "My
          Lady."  I have not yet been informed which title your ladyship has
          pleased to select?
               PHYL.  I—I haven't quite decided.  You see, I have no mother
          to advise me!
               STREPH.  No.  I have.
               PHYL.  Yes; a young mother.
               STREPH.  Not very—a couple of centuries or so.
               PHYL.  Oh!  She wears well.
               STREPH.  She does.  She's a fairy.
               PHYL.  I beg your pardon—a what?
               STREPH.  Oh, I've no longer any reason to conceal the
          fact—she's a fairy.
               PHYL.  A fairy!  Well, but—that would account for a good many
          things!  Then—I suppose you're a fairy?
               STREPH.  I'm half a fairy.
               PHYL.  Which half?
               STREPH.  The upper half—down to the waistcoat.
               PHYL.  Dear me!  (Prodding him with her fingers.)  There is
          nothing to show it!
               STREPH.  Don't do that.
               PHYL.  But why didn't you tell me this before?
               STREPH.  I thought you would take a dislike to me.  But as
          it's all off, you may as well know the truth—I'm only half a
          mortal!
               PHYL. (crying).  But I'd rather have half a mortal I do love,
          than half a dozen I don't!
               STREPH.  Oh, I think not—go to your half-dozen.
               PHYL. (crying).  It's only two! and I hate 'em!  Please
          forgive me!
               STREPH.  I don't think I ought to.  Besides, all sorts of
          difficulties will arise.  You know, my grandmother looks quite as
          young as my mother.  So do all my aunts.
               PHYL.  I quite understand.  Whenever I see you kissing a very
          young lady, I shall know it's an elderly relative.
               STREPH.  You will?  Then, Phyllis, I think we shall be very
          happy!  (Embracing her.)
               PHYL.  We won't wait long.
               STREPH.  No.  We might change our minds.  We'll get married
          first.
               PHYL.  And change our minds afterwards?
               STREPH.  That's the usual course.
        
                             DUET—STREPHON and PHYLLIS.
        
          STREPH.        If we're weak enough to tarry
                              Ere we marry,
                                   You and I,
                         Of the feeling I inspire
                              You may tire
                                   By and by.
                         For peers with flowing coffers
                              Press their offers—
                                   That is why
                         I am sure we should not tarry
                              Ere we marry,
                                   You and I!
        
          PHYL.          If we're weak enough to tarry
                              Ere we marry,
                                   You and I,
                         With a more attractive maiden,
                              Jewel-laden,
                                   You may fly.
                         If by chance we should be parted,
                              Broken-hearted
                                   I should die—
                         So I think we will not tarry
                              Ere we marry,
                                   You and I.
        
               PHYL.  But does your mother know you're—I mean, is she aware
          of our engagement?
        
                                 (Enter Iolanthe.)
        
               IOL.  She is; and thus she welcomes her daughter-in-law!
          (Kisses her.)
               PHYL.  She kisses just like other people!  But the Lord
          Chancellor?
               STREPH.  I forgot him!  Mother, none can resist your fairy
          eloquence; you will go to him and plead for us?
               IOL. (much agitated).  No, no; impossible!
               STREPH.  But our happiness—our very lives—depend upon our
          obtaining his consent!
               PHYL.  Oh, madam, you cannot refuse to do this!
               IOL.  You know not what you ask!  The Lord Chancellor is—my
          husband!
          STREPH. and PHYL.  Your husband!
               IOL.  My husband and your father!  (Addressing Strephon, who
          is much moved.)
               PHYLL.  Then our course is plain; on his learning that
          Strephon is his son, all objection to our marriage will be at once
          removed!
               IOL.  No; he must never know!  He believes me to have died
          childless, and, dearly as I love him, I am bound, under penalty of
          death, not to undeceive him.  But see—he comes!  Quick—my veil!
        
          (Iolanthe veils herself.  Strephon and Phyllis go off on tiptoe.)
        
                              (Enter Lord Chancellor.)
        
               LORD CH.  Victory!  Victory!  Success has crowned my efforts,
          and I may consider myself engaged to Phyllis!  At first I wouldn't
          hear of it—it was out of the question.  But I took heart.  I
          pointed out to myself that I was no stranger to myself; that, in
          point of fact, I had been personally acquainted with myself for
          some years.  This had its effect.  I admitted that I had watched my
          professional advancement with considerable interest, and I
          handsomely added that I yielded to no one in admiration for my
          private and professional virtues.  This was a great point gained.
          I then endeavoured to work upon my feelings.  Conceive my joy when
          I distinctly perceived a tear glistening in my own eye!
          Eventually, after a severe struggle with myself, I
          reluctantly—most reluctantly—consented.
        
                                                        (Iolanthe comes down
          veiled.)
        
                            RECITATIVE—IOLANTHE (kneeling).
        
                    My lord, a suppliant at your feet I kneel,
                    Oh, listen to a mother's fond appeal!
                    Hear me to-night!  I come in urgent need—
                    'Tis for my son, young Strephon, that I plead!
        
                                  BALLAD—IOLANTHE.
        
                         He loves!  If in the bygone years
                              Thine eyes have ever shed
                         Tears—bitter, unavailing tears,
                              For one untimely dead—
                         If, in the eventide of life,
                              Sad thoughts of her arise,
                         Then let the memory of thy wife
                              Plead for my boy—he dies!
        
                         He dies!  If fondly laid aside
                              In some old cabinet,
                         Memorials of thy long-dead bride
                              Lie, dearly treasured yet,
                         Then let her hallowed bridal dress—
                              Her little dainty gloves—
                         Her withered flowers—her faded tress—
                              Plead for my boy—he loves!
        
          (The Lord Chancellor is moved by this appeal.  After a pause.)
        
          LORD CH.  It may not be—for so the fates decide!
                    Learn thou that Phyllis is my promised bride.
          IOL. (in horror).   Thy bride!  No! no!
          LORD CH.            It shall be so!
                    Those who would separate us woe betide!
        
          IOL.      My doom thy lips have spoken—
                                        I plead in vain!
        
          CHORUS OF FAIRIES (without).       Forbear! forbear!
        
          IOL.      A vow already broken
                                        I break again!
        
          CHORUS OF FAIRIES (without).       Forbear! forbear!
        
          IOL.      For him—for her—for thee
                                        I yield my life.
                    Behold—it may not be!
                                        I am thy wife.
        
          CHORUS OF FAIRIES (without).       Aiaiah! Aiaiah! Willaloo!
        
          LORD CH. (recognizing her).   Iolanthe! thou livest?
        
          IOL.                                    Aye!
                                        I live!  Now let me die!
        
          (Enter Fairy Queen and Fairies.  Iolanthe kneels to her.)
        
          QUEEN.    Once again thy vows are broken:
                    Thou thyself thy doom hast spoken!
        
          CHORUS OF FAIRIES.            Aiaiah! Aiaiah!
                                             Willahalah! Willaloo!
                                             Willahalah! Willaloo!
        
          QUEEN.    Bow thy head to Destiny:
                    Death thy doom, and thou shalt die!
        
          CHORUS OF FAIRIES.            Aiaiah! Aiaiah! etc.
        
          (Peers and Sentry enter.  The Queen raises her spear.)
        
               LEILA.  Hold!  If Iolanthe must die, so must we all; for, as
          she has sinned, so have we!
               QUEEN.  What?
               CELIA.  We are all fairy duchesses, marchionesses, countesses,
          viscountesses, and baronesses.
               LORD MOUNT.  It's our fault.  They couldn't help themselves.
               QUEEN.  It seems they have helped themselves, and pretty
          freely, too!  (After a pause.)  You have all incurred death; but I
          can't slaughter the whole company!  And yet (unfolding a scroll)
          the law is clear—every fairy must die who marries a mortal!
               LORD CH.  Allow me, as an old Equity draftsman, to make a
          suggestion.  The subtleties of the legal mind are equal to the
          emergency.  The thing is really quite simple—the insertion of a
          single word will do it.  Let it stand that every fairy shall die
          who doesn't marry a mortal, and there you are, out of your
          difficulty at once!
               QUEEN.  We like your humour.  Very well!  (Altering the MS. in
          pencil.)  Private Willis!
               SENTRY (coming forward).  Ma'am!
               QUEEN.  To save my life, it is necessary that I marry at once.
          How should you like to be a fairy guardsman?
               SENTRY.  Well, ma'am, I don't think much of the British
          soldier who wouldn't ill-convenience himself to save a female in
          distress.
               QUEEN.  You are a brave fellow.  You're a fairy from this
          moment.  (Wings spring from Sentry's shoulders.)  And you, my
          Lords, how say you, will you join our ranks?
        
                                  (Fairies kneel to Peers and implore them to
          do so.)
        
                              (Phyllis and Strephon enter.)
        
               LORD MOUNT. (to Lord Tolloller).  Well, now that the Peers are
          to be recruited entirely from persons of intelligence, I really
          don't see what use we are, down here, do you, Tolloller?
               LORD TOLL.  None whatever.
               QUEEN.  Good!  (Wings spring from shoulders of Peers.)  Then
          away we go to Fairyland.
        
                                       FINALE.
        
          PHYL.               Soon as we may,
                              Off and away!
                         We'll commence our journey airy—
                              Happy are we—
                              As you can see,
                         Every one is now a fairy!
        
          ALL.           Every, every, every,
                         Every one is now a fairy!
        
          IOL., QUEEN,   Though as a general rule we know
          and PHYL.      Two strings go to every bow,
                         Make up your minds that grief 'twill bring
                         If you've two beaux to every string.
        
          ALL.           Though as a general rule, etc.
        
          LORDCH.             Up in the sky,
                              Ever so high,
                         Pleasures come in endless series;
                              We will arrange
                              Happy exchange—
                         House of Peers for House of Peris!
        
          ALL.           Peris, Peris, Peris,
                         House of Peers for House of Peris!
        
          LORDS CH.,          Up in the air, sky-high, sky-high,
          MOUNT.,             Free from Wards in Chancery,
          and TOLL.           I/He will be surely happier, for
                              I'm/He's such a susceptible Chancellor.
        
          ALL.                Up in the air, etc.
        
                                       CURTAIN</p>
